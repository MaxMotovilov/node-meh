## TL;DR
* What: a better way to build scalable and reliable HTTP service stacks
* Why: no hidden state, request tract can cross process and host boundaries -- with ZeroMQ!
* Interoperable with Express/Connect and with Connect-style middleware 
* One day, we can get rid of HTTP reverse proxies and talk to front Web server via ZeroMQ!
